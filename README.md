Project 1

Best Model - Naive Bayes:

Error Rate 0.079

Accuracy Rate 0.921

True Positives 0.328

True Negatives 0.968


Naive Bayes has highest true negative prediction, which would make it a good model to help alert people who are writing reviews that are unhelpful. If a review is flagged, then the user could be shown some tips to improve their review. 


Project 2

Best Model - Ridge Regression:

Variance Training: 0.83

Variance Test: 0.76

Would be interesting to create some sort of online tool for people changing industries or cities to see what they should use as a starting point of negotiation for their new salary. 


Project 3

Number of Clusters: 120

Obvious use is a recommendation systemâ€¦ another idea could be grouping for price comparisons?
